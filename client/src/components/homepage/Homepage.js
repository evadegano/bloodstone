            <p>Quartz is a decentralized cash system that allows anyone with a wifi connection to make fast and secure worldwide transactions. 
              <br/>While it is built like a blockchain, Quartz stores its data on a graph database that is distributed among all users.
              <br/>No need to download a whole copy of the blockchain. Every user stores part of the data and can validate and mine blocks if they want to. 
              

              <br/><span className="text-highlight">By combining the power of modern databases with the integrity of blockchains, Quartz offers a way to securely make transactions while still providing easy ways to query the data.</span>
